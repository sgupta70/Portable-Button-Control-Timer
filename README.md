# Portable-Button-Control-Timer

## Description
We are trying to create a working timer for baking. It will keep track of how much time has passed, and go up to 30 minutes.

## Week Accomplishments

So far we have accomplished the rough design/build of our timer and the base of the code. We have gotten more comfortable with building on OnShape,though we still have to edit the specifics, and we have learned more about code. The code is the part we still have to learn the most about.
We are on track, with only needing to resize specific parts of the build, and make the code more exact on what we want it to do.

## Week Accomplishments (Week 15-19)

This week we continued our design on OnShape, we are almost done with the design. We are still fixing a couple of things but the overall design is done. The code is coming along, we are still working on that a little more. We are trying to get the servo to continue to move slower, which has been a little complicated. We have made the timer base, with holes for the servo and buttons. We have also made a clear case to go around our timer to keep all the wiring in and nice. We are still moving a couple things around to make sure everything fits. The project is really coming along, and we have made a lot of progess. Some of our obstacles include not being able to get together and see each other, and we have been hitting multiple obstacles with the code. It's really hard working over zoom, we can't really see what the other person is doing and what they need help with, so thats been pretty difficult. When we run into a problem or need help we aren't able to get help right away which can also be a bit of an obstacle, but it's been super hard for everyone working in this setting. We aren't super sure how to overcome them but we are continuing to work through them, and hopefully when we get to go back to school things will strat coming together. 

## Week Accomplishments (Week 29-2) 

The project is going well, we have learned a lot on OnShape, and have gotten a lot more comfortable working on it. Our code is coming along very slowly, so we are struggling with that and trying to work on it, and get some help with it. We understand what we are supposed to do, we just don't really know how to start writing it out, so thats been kind of hard. We are not on time, but we've been working very well together, and continuing to complete the project. 

One major obstacle is the code, we both aren't the best at that, so we have been running into a lot of problems. It's also been hard trying to get help, right when we need it. Another big obstacle was not being able to see each other, and now we have realized that we will be on different days, which will definitely be something we have to get used too, and it will be a challenge at first, but we should be able to overcome it. 

Kathryn - When I return to school from Spring break, the first thing I'm going to do is try to get more help with anything I need too, and get as close as we can to start printing and assembling our project. Also continue the code and get some help. 

Sahana - When I return to school from Spring break, the first thing I'm going to do is get a lot of help on the code, and continue to work on it. I understood what we were supposed to do I just am not entirely sure how to type it out, and start it.
