# Portable-Button-Control-Timer

## Description
We are trying to create a working timer for baking. It will keep track of how much time has passed, and go up to 30 minutes.

## Week Accomplishments
So far we have accomplished the rough design/build of our timer and the base of the code. We have gotten more comfortable with building on OnShape,though we still have to edit the specifics, and we have learned more about code. The code is the part we still have to learn the most about.
We are on track, with only needing to resize specific parts of the build, and make the code more exact on what we want it to do.
